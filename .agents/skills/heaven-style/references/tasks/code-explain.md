# Code Explain Task

## Goal

Answer code and architecture questions as if the reader is new to the repo. Make the mental model clear from both user and system perspectives, grounded in current source evidence.

## Scope Discovery

1. Identify the audience: user, developer, maintainer, reviewer, or mixed.
2. Identify the target: whole repo, architecture slice, module, feature, data flow, bug, diff, commit range, branch, or Linear issue.
3. Read `AGENTS.md`, relevant docs, nearby source, tests, generated artifacts, and examples in the relevant rules before explaining behavior.
4. For HeavenBase architecture, prefer current docs such as `docs/resources/architecture/mental-model.md`, `docs/resources/architecture/concepts-and-classes.md`, `docs/resources/architecture/data-flows.md`, `docs/resources/architecture/routing-and-explain.md`, and `docs/resources/reports/capabilities.md` when present, then verify against source.
5. Verify behavior against current HeavenBase source and docs; for legacy names, see [compat.md](../rules/code/python/compat.md).
6. If the user wants a new design, architecture health review, periodic review, or refactor plan rather than an explanation, route to [arch-design.md](arch-design.md).

## Explanation Structure

Use the smallest structure that answers the question. For broad explanations, include:

- One-sentence answer.
- User perspective: what the user writes, sees, configures, and expects.
- System perspective: which objects/modules handle the request and where control/data move next.
- Data flow: inputs, normalization, planning/routing, handler/backend execution, result shaping, catalog/docs sync when relevant.
- Architecture map: key packages/classes/functions and why they exist.
- Illustration: Mermaid diagram, compact table, or step list when it reduces cognitive load.
- Code references: clickable file/line links when available.
- Code-change comparison: before/after behavior, API surface, migration impact, tests/docs implications, and risks.
- Summary: what to remember and what to read next.

## Style Criteria

- Start concrete, then generalize. Avoid dumping every class before the reader knows the use case.
- Keep public terms stable: `heavenbase as hb`, entity, workspace, backend, handler, registry, query, catalog, config.
- Separate facts from inference. Say when an explanation is inferred from tests or code shape.
- Prefer diagrams for multi-hop flows, but do not use diagrams as decoration.
- Use examples that can plausibly run in the current repo.
- If the question asks for a recommendation, include tradeoffs and a direct next step.

## Output Modes

- **Quick answer:** 1-3 paragraphs plus key files.
- **Walkthrough:** sections for user perspective, system perspective, data flow, key files, and summary.
- **Diff explanation:** what changed, why it matters, behavior impact, compatibility/migration, tests/docs.
- **Onboarding map:** architecture layers, common entrypoints, glossary, and first files to read.
