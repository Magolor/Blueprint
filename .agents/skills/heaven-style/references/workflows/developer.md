# Developer Workflow

## When to use

Use this surface for advanced planning while **implementing** large refactors, architecture decisions, public API design, rule tradeoffs, or any coding task where `SKILL.md` plus one task playbook is not enough. Typical triggers: cross-module refactors, shared utility changes, new backends/providers, storage/query behavior, Linear milestones with many slices, coding-standard changes, or disputes between rules.

For **design-only** work — doc organization, module designs, refactor plans, goals updates, API standard tables, or step-by-step execution plans before code — use [architect.md](architect.md) instead; return here once implementation starts.

## Decision workflow

1. Classify the work: feature, bug fix, refactor, public API design, review, docs sync, extension, or skill edit.
2. Read [../rules/overview.md](../rules/overview.md), then load every rule likely to affect the touched surface.
3. Read examples inside the highest-risk rules; examples teach one focus but must satisfy all cross-rules.
4. Read the target repo `AGENTS.md`, command wrappers, config defaults, public docs, architecture notes, and nearby implementation patterns.
5. Map each planned change to rule IDs and identify any waiver before implementation starts.
6. Choose minimal diffs that preserve behavior unless the task explicitly asks for a behavior change.
7. Define verification before editing: scanner, `rtk` + `uv`-backed lint/format/test wrappers (`scripts/flake.bash`, `scripts/test.bash`, `scripts/sync-env.bash --check`), targeted tests, examples, docs generators, and issue-status updates.

## Linear milestone loop

Use this loop for large HeavenBase stabilization work:

1. Read the Linear issue, comments, linked issues, attached plan files, and previous review artifacts.
2. Convert the objective into slices with acceptance criteria, explicit non-goals, and verification gates.
3. Implement one slice at a time; after each slice, run a focused probe/test and update the local plan.
4. Review the diff, fix confirmed findings, and rerun targeted validation before broad flake/test.
5. Sync docs, examples, generated docs, and Linear issue status before reporting completion.

## Full-rule reading

Load all code-quality rules for public APIs, shared utilities, or broad refactors:

- `util`, `config`, `types`, `oop`, `model`, `name`, `py`, `clean`, `error`, `sql`, `compat`

Load project rules when the task touches release readiness:

- `environment`, `format`, `test`, `docs`, `review`, `extension`

Load task playbooks when their triggers match:

- [../tasks/code.md](../tasks/code.md) for implementation, bug fix, feature, refactor, tests, or docs.
- [../tasks/code-review.md](../tasks/code-review.md) for reviews of diffs, branches, modules, recent changes, PRs, or Linear issues.
- [../tasks/doc-sync.md](../tasks/doc-sync.md) for English Mintlify docs, navigation, or sibling docs sync.
- [../tasks/doc-trans.md](../tasks/doc-trans.md) for line-aligned Chinese (`zh/`) MDX translation.
- [../tasks/code-explain.md](../tasks/code-explain.md) for newcomer-oriented architecture, dataflow, module, feature, or diff explanations.
- [../tasks/manager.md](../tasks/manager.md) for GitHub/Linear status tracking, stale-work triage, and multi-task orchestration.
- [../tasks/skill-update.md](../tasks/skill-update.md) for maintaining this skill, script contracts, and version alignment.

Load failure playbooks when commands repeatedly fail:

- [../failures/env.md](../failures/env.md) for Python, Conda, shell, and PATH failures.
- [../failures/network-proxy.md](../failures/network-proxy.md) for CLI/API network or proxy failures.
- [../failures/auth-secrets.md](../failures/auth-secrets.md) for MCP, provider, Linear, Tavily, LLM API key, token, or GraphQL fallback issues.
- [../failures/linear-pressure.md](../failures/linear-pressure.md) for Linear project issue pressure, blocked issue creation, or comment compression.

## Philosophy

Heaven Style is portable across developments, but HeavenBase is the shared infrastructure layer. Default to `heavenbase`, `heavenbase.utils`, and `CM_HVNB` for utilities, config, logging, serialization, shell execution, IDs, LLM, DB, workspace, and MCP behavior. Downstream packages may add thin domain wrappers, but wrappers should call HeavenBase utilities rather than reimplementing stdlib access.

Prefer a single canonical API over compatibility branches. Prefer explicit config ownership over hidden globals. Prefer small, composable public surfaces with stable vocabulary over alternate-name-heavy APIs.

## Planning output

A developer-level plan should include:

- Goal and success criteria.
- Rule IDs that govern the change.
- Public APIs/interfaces affected.
- Implementation approach and non-goals.
- Tests, examples, docs, and verification commands.
- Waivers, compatibility choices, migration notes, and issue-status/doc-sync actions.
